    "text": "Python is a popular and versatile programming language that is easy to learn and read. It enables quick and efficient work in tasks like plotting, data analysis, and simulations. Although not the fastest or most efficient (like, for instance, C++), it is versatile and fun to use, particularly for science applications.\nIn this seminar, we will explore how Python can implement various techniques for solving physics problems. This seminar is not exhaustive but aims to cover a few concepts so you can be exposed to different methods (such as Monte Carlo) and understand different programming approaches (such as object-oriented programming). This experience will complement and supplement what you will learn in your other courses.\n\n\n\nThe material is designed to accommodate varying levels of knowledge, from beginners to advanced users.\nThe goal is to progress from your starting point, regardless of where that may be. “…what ultimately matters in this [seminar] is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates but where you will end up relative to yourself when you began” (Quote from Harvard University’s CS50 course (“CS50” 2024))\nThe best way to learn programming is by doing, so expect to spend plenty of time experimenting and practicing.\nYou are not expected to work on the seminar content outside the seminar hours. The material introduced in the seminar has been intentionally reduced over time to accommodate carryover work from the previous day.\nYou also do not have to complete every topic and problem! Often, you will learn more by focusing on doing a few things well(the cliché less is more).\nYou can work on the material independently. The facilitator’s role will be to:\n\nExplain and clarify topics beyond the provided material.\nPersonalise the learning experience by spending time with each participant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 1: This is the most demanding day, covering various topics. If you are new to Python, focus on the basics by practicing examples and exercises. If you are more experienced, briefly review the basics before diving into the more advanced topics. Work through the exercises and try your best to complete as many as possible.\nDay 2: We’ll explore using random numbers to solve simple problems, including electron and Brownian motion.\nDay 3: Focus on interacting systems such as the Boltzmann distribution and the Ising model.\nDay 4: Work with differential equations.Start working on your group project.\nDay 5: Complete the group project and present.",
